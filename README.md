# Developers:
- Tony Lim
- Adam Bodicoat
- Andy Zhang

### Built With
- Java
- JavaFX
- CSS

## Project Requirements
- Design your own escape room and riddles to solve
- Riddles and interactions must be generated programmatically by GPT
- Presence of an intelligent 'Game Master' utilising OpenAI's API
- Incorporate text-to-speech for accessibility
- Application menu with difficulty levels and time limits
- Inclusion of randomness in game design for replayability

## To setup OpenAI's API

- add in the root of the project (i.e., the same level where `pom.xml` is located) a file named `apiproxy.config`
- put inside the credentials that you received from no-reply@digitaledu.ac.nz (put the quotes "")

  ```
  email: "upi123@aucklanduni.ac.nz"
  apiKey: "YOUR_KEY"
  ```
  these are your credentials to invoke the OpenAI GPT APIs

## To setup codestyle's API

- add in the root of the project (i.e., the same level where `pom.xml` is located) a file named `codestyle.config`
- put inside the credentials that you received from gradestyle@digitaledu.ac.nz (put the quotes "")

  ```
  email: "upi123@aucklanduni.ac.nz"
  accessToken: "YOUR_KEY"
  ```

 these are your credentials to invoke GradeStyle

## Clone the repo into your IDE
